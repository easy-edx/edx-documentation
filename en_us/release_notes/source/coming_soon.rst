****************************************
New Drag and Drop Problem Type
****************************************

A new drag and drop problem type is currently under development. The new drag
and drop problem type is much easier to create, is more flexible and
accessible, and works on mobile devices. The new problem type will eventually
replace the current drag and drop problem type for new course content. The new
drag and drop problem type will not affect existing courses that include drag
and drop problems created using the older problem type.
