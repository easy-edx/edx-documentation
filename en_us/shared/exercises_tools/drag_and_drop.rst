*********************************
Overview
*********************************

A drag and drop problem includes a background image and one or more draggable
images that learners move into target zones on the background image. You can
include as many draggable items and as many target zones as you need. You can
include decoy items that do not have a target and you can include decoy targets
that do not correspond to draggable items.

The background image

A target zone is a rectangular area on the background image. You can display or hide the borders of a zone for learners. You can add labels for zones or leave them unlabeled.

A draggable item is a rectangle that contains either a label or an image. The size of the rectangle depends on the amount or text in the label or the size of the image. You can set the background color and the label text color for the items in a problem.
